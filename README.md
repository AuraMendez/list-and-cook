# list-and-cook
easy decisions - easy groceries

## < / salt > Hackday

This app is for people like me, who struggle with deciding what to cook and planning your meals and groceries for the week.

### Basic functionality

- The user can browse through the recipes in the databes assign them to the menus for each day of the week.
- the app then generates a shopping list for the week.

### What I didn't have time for :(

Lesson learned: I tried to bite off more than I could chew and my app lacks some important features.

What needs fixing:

- click on a recipe to display it
- delete buttons
- complete server setup
- gracious error handling
- sort lists alphabetically
- use ref for eventListeners
- join together similar ingredients on the shopping list
- styling can be drastically improved
- add a proxy

### Ideas for the future

- add photos to the recipes
- make it more user friendly: drag and drop the recipes intead of copy paste
- make it responsive: on mobile the weekdays section is a retractable bar
- remove button for elements from the generated shopping list (like what you have at home already)
- build the database in a way with more potential (eg. Mongo)
- Posibility to:
    - generate pdf from the weekly menu and/or shopping list.
    - export the list to other apps (like Microsoft toDo)
- user login
    - add you own recipes to the database
    - save your favourite recipes
    - display the recipes that you haven't cooked in a while first
- implement unit conversion
